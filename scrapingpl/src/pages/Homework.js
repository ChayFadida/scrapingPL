        <h3>Query Execution Times and Analysis:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top 10 Streaks of All Time</strong>: Retrieves the top 10 streaks of all time (all seasons) for players of English descent still playing for teams from London. <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 95.85 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Top 20 Goalkeepers</strong>: Identifies the top 20 goalkeepers who come from outside of Europe and have the most clean sheets (games without conceding goals). <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 94.50 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Aston Villa Player News</strong>: Fetches all the news related to players from Aston Villa whose transfer status is either "transfer in" or "loan out." <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 20.06 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Analysis:</h4>
        <p>The first two queries are performed on the statistics page, which includes multiple filters and a large table. The queries need to browse and filter results from this extensive dataset, contributing to their longer runtime.</p>
        <p>The third query, on the other hand, operates on a smaller page with a more focused dataset, resulting in a significantly shorter runtime.</p>
        <h4>Optimization:</h4>
        <p>The times for the first two queries can potentially be reduced by employing more efficient technologies or optimizing the database queries. Techniques such as indexing, query optimization, or improved data retrieval methods may help shorten the execution time.</p>
