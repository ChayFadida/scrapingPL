        <h3>Query Execution Times and Analysis:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top 10 Streaks of All Time</strong>: Retrieves the top 10 streaks of all time (all seasons) for players of English descent still playing for teams from London. <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 95.85 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Top 20 Goalkeepers</strong>: Identifies the top 20 goalkeepers who come from outside of Europe and have the most clean sheets (games without conceding goals). <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 94.50 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Aston Villa Player News</strong>: Fetches all the news related to players from Aston Villa whose transfer status is either "transfer in" or "loan out." <br /> <strong>Query Runtime</strong>: 20.06 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Analysis:</h4>
        <p>The first two queries are performed on the statistics page, which includes multiple filters and a large table. The queries need to browse and filter results from this extensive dataset, contributing to their longer runtime.</p>
        <p>The third query, on the other hand, operates on a smaller page with a more focused dataset, resulting in a significantly shorter runtime.</p>
        <h4>Optimization:</h4>
        <p>The times for the first two queries can potentially be reduced by employing more efficient technologies or optimizing the database queries. Techniques such as indexing, query optimization, or improved data retrieval methods may help shorten the execution time.</p>

        <p>These pages have been selected to analyze their PageRank and link structure. The calculations were performed using the <code>networkx</code> library. We created a directed graph with a node for each link and a script to search hrefs from the same list of nodes within each page. As soon as we found a link to another page, we added a corresponding edge.</p>
        <p>For PageRank calculations, we used an alpha value of 0.85. The graph illustrating the link structure and PageRank results is shown below:</p>

      <div>
        <p>According to the PageRank results, we observe that only one page is ranked significantly higher than the others. To evaluate the relevance of the search results, we gathered feedback from two users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User A:</strong> Marked all pages as relevant except for the page with the URL <a href="https://www.itfc.co.uk/news/2024/august/05/loan-move-for-elkan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loan Move for Elkan (August 5, 2024)</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>User B:</strong> Marked all pages as relevant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on this feedback, we can enhance the queries by incorporating additional ranking criteria. For example, we could include parameters that reflect personal relevance to users, such as whether a player is part of the senior squad or the youth team. This adjustment will better align search results with user preferences and improve the quality of the search experience.</p>
